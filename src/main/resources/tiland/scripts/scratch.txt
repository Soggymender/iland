As a former Junior Temple Guard, surely you are aware of the importance of the Great Red Herring to our people's way of life.

At the end of the game the Great Red Herring becomes of age, and is eaten at the annual village feast.
You can remove the Great Red Herring from its bath but it will always find its way back.
